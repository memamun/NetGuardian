## Material Design 3 / M3 Expressive

The M3 spec lives at `.antigravity/m3-expressive/`.

Before writing or reviewing any Material Design UI (components, dp values, corner radii,
motion springs, type styles, color roles, adaptive layouts), read
`.antigravity/m3-expressive/SKILL.md` and follow its "Where to look" table into the
specific reference file.

Never state a number, token name, or component name from memory. Look it up:
- exact values (type scale, radii, springs, elevation) -> `references/tokens.md`
- per-component dp geometry -> `references/component-tokens.md`
- component behavior, variants, do/don'ts -> `references/components/*.md`
- platform API availability -> `references/platforms.md`

If a value genuinely isn't in M3, say so and label it "my design decision (not in M3)"
rather than presenting it as spec.
